# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles and config files. I'm using MacOS, Vim/Neovim and ZSH with Antigen.

The **install.sh** script links all **.symlink** files to the home directory, prompts for gitconfig user/email - which are saved in **.gitconfig.local** and included in the main **.gitconfig**, and installs brew packages and vscode extensions.
