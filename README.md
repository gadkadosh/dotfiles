# dotfiles
These are just my dotfiles. There are tons of great dotfiles and systems for managing them around. For now I chose my own simple solution.

Currently I have .bash_profile and .gitconfig, and I use MacOS.
There's a small shell script to automatically create symlinks in the home directory.
